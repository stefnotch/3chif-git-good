## What is Git?
> Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. -- Wikipedia


Git is a magical piece of software that allows you to work "together". (Version control system)  
The code is hosted on a server. (**GitHub** or **GitLab**)  
You have a copy of everything (**GitHub for Desktop** or **GitKraken** deals with that copy) 
After you change a bit of stuff, you have to **commit** it with GitHub for Desktop. (That's a backup/snapshot)  
Then, when you are happy with everything, you **push** it to the server. (Upload)  
After you **pushed** your code to the server, everybody else has to **pull** it. (Download)

It looks kinda like this:
